          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            The backbone of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer
            (eBC) is the sequential administration of anthracyclines and
            taxanes. The administration of the initially planned dose-intensity
            of paclitaxel is frequently hampered by side effects, mainly
            chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Importantly, there is no
            established strategy to treat or prevent this side effect. Despite
            these facts, no previous study has assessed the effects of reduced
            paclitaxel dose-intensity administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a retrospective cohort of TNBC and HER2-positive EBC treated
            in the neoadjuvant setting with anthracyclines-cyclophosphamide and
            weekly paclitaxel or carboplatin-paclitaxel (with or without
            trastuzumab ± pertuzumab) collected at 8 different cancer centres
            across Europe, <strong>we aim to: </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Primary Objective: </strong>highlight a potential impact
              of reduced paclitaxel dose-intensity on treatment effect (pCR rate
              at post-neoadjuvant surgery) and invasive breast cancer-free
              survival,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secondary Objective: </strong>Estimate if this impact
              differs according to the breast cancer subtype,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secondary Objective: </strong>Characterize TNBC/HER2+
              early Breast Cancer Patients treated in the neoadjuvant setting
              with anthracyclinescyclophosphamide and subsequent paclitaxel with
              respect to demographics and clinical characteristics at diagnosis
              index date and treatment received.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exploratory Objective: </strong>highlight a potential
              impact of reduced paclitaxel dose-intensity on overall survival
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exploratory Objective: </strong>Characterize the clinical
              factors and side effects associated with early cessation or
              dose-intensity reduction of paclitaxel administration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exploratory Objective: </strong>Assess and quantify the
              frequency of early cessation and dose reduction of paclitaxel
              administration in patients presenting with treatment-induced
              neuropathy.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The homogeneity of the treatment schedules across the different
            centres and the binary readout of the efficacy outcome (pCR at
            postneoadjuvant surgery) will allow us to perform a reliable
            analysis of the datasets.

          <h5>Treatment intensity index</h5>
          <p>
            Possible strategies for reducing the intensity of paclitaxel
            treatment include:<br />
            - reducing the dose at each cycle,<br />
            - reducing the number of cycles (i.e., early cessation),<br />
            - increasing the time interval between cycles.<br />
            These modifications to the treatment regimen can be analysed
            directly in terms of <em>X</em> mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose reduction,
            <em>X</em> cycles omitted, or <em>X</em> days prolonged
            administration interval, but can also be quantified as a
            standardised relative value to the expected/standard regimen (i.e.
            80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly in 12 cycles). Lets denote <em>n</em> is
            the number of cycles, <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> is the dose at the
            <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> cycle and <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> is the time
            of the <em>i<sup>th</sup></em> cycle from the start of treatment.
            For each patient, the three dimensions/factors of relative treatment
            intensity (from 0 to 1) can be expressed as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Dose-intensity factor (DIF)</em> - The DIF value expresses the
            proportion of the average dose applied in each administration
            compared to the standard 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. This factor does not
            fully represent a reduction in the total cumulative dose (e.g. early
            cessation of treatment has no effect here), but focuses specifically
            on the change in treatment intensity using a dose reduction strategy
            if treatment is administered.<br />

              height="46"
            />
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <em>Cycles-completeness factor (CCF)</em> - The CCF value represents
            the proportion of cycles completed compared to the standard 12
            cycles. This factor represents the completeness of treatment simply
            in terms of actual paclitaxel administrations, regardless of
            possible dose reduction or time delay.<br />

              width="95"
              height="37"
            />
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <em>Time-adherence factor (TAF)</em>- The TAF value expresses the
            inverted ratio of the average time between each cycle compared to
            the standard 7 days. In the context of treatment intensity, this
            factor represents the level of adherence to the time schedule (the
            smaller the value towards zero, the more spread out the treatment is
            over time). If the patient has completed only one cycle, the time
            interval cannot be calculated, but this factor takes the value of 1
            because it is not an interval prolongation strategy.<br />

            Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe the analyzed
            cohort: mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range are
            given for continuous variables and absolute and relative frequencies
            are given for categorical variables. When testing for differences
            between the TNBC and Her2+ patients (or other stratification
            variable) the Pearson's chi-square test (for nominal variables),
            t-test (for continuous variables) and Mann-Whitney test (for ordinal
            variables) were used. When the assumptions for the Pearson's
            chi-square test and t-test are not met, the Fisher's exact test and
            Mann-Whitney test were used instead, respectively. Due to the
            anonymisation of the data, some centres could not share the exact
            age of the patients at the time of diagnosis and instead age
            categories (e.g. 10-year intervals) were given. To utilize these
            data correctly, they were treated as interval-censored and a
            survival regression model with normally distributed errors was used
            to estimate basic descriptive statistics and test for differences.

          <p>
            To identify the optimal cut-off value of paclitaxel dose intensity
            the CART (Classification And Regression Tree) algorithm for pCR
            prediction was used and the first splitting rule was selected as the
            best criterion to distinguish patients with/without pCR. The same
            cut-off was then used in the analysis of invasive breast cancer-free
            survival (IBCFS) and overall survival (OS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of
            individual potential predictors of pCR. Similarly, in the case of
            the invasive breast cancer-free survival (IBCFS) analysis and
            overall survival (OS) analysis, the Cox proportional hazards
            regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). When
            fitting multivariate models, only predictors giving statistically
            significant results were consecutively selected. In the case of
            correlation between significant predictors, preference was always
            given to the one whose data were more available and reliable across
            all centres (e.g. age over menopausal status). Similarly, primary
            classifications were preferred over derived ones (cT and cN over
            UICC/AJCC staging). In addition, the sybtype of disease and any
            variable of interest (e.g. toxicity for predicting reduced dose
            intensity, etc.) was always kept in the multivariate model. Missing
            data for individual factors were included in the multivariate models
            as a separate category and their effect on the final prediction was
            checked (if not statistically significant, their HR and OR are not
            reported in the results). Statistical significance testing of HR and
            OR were performed at the 5% significance level.

          <h3>A. Basic description</h3>
          <p>
            Basic descriptive statistics are calculated for the complete dataset
            of all patients. In addition, a comparison is made between two
            groups of patients with different disease subtypes (TNBC vs. Her2+).
            For clarity, the results are divided into separate tables for
            patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, neoadjuvant
            treatment course, toxicity, surgery and adjuvant treatment. A
            detailed description is made for paclitaxel treatment, where
            information on its course and possible reduction of treatment
            intensity is given in a separate table. Two parameters expressing
            the intensity of paclitaxel treatment are visualized in separate
            graphs to show their dristibution.

            As part of the evaluation of paclitaxel reduction, in addition to
            the standard descriptive statistics (see
            <a href="files/results/A03b.pdf" target="_blank">Table A.03b</a>),
            the reasons for dose reduction, early discontinuation, and
            prolongation of the interval between paclitaxel administrations are
            summarised. Patients were then divided into two groups according to
            dose intensity (Scenario A) or treatment intensity (Scenario B) and
            descriptive statistics of paclitaxel treatment setting are presented
            for these groups. Finally, logistic regression was also used to
            assess patient baseline characteristics and toxicity during
            treatment as possible predictors of treatment intensity reduction.

            Univariate logistic regression models were first used to assess
            predictors associated with achieving a pathological complete
            response (pCR). In addition to all baseline characteristics,
            neoadjuvant treatment regimen and toxicity, various parameters of

            models that estimate the effect of treatment intensity reduction
            (under both scenario A and B) on pathological complete response,

          <h3>D. Invasive breast cancer-free survival (IBCFS)</h3>
          <p>
            Univariate Cox regression models were first used to assess
            predictors associated with a risk of invasive breast cancer event.
            In addition to all baseline characteristics, neoadjuvant treatment
            regimen and toxicity, various parameters of paclitaxel intensity
            reduction rate were analyzed in detail. The main outputs of this
            part of the analysis are then multivariate models that estimate the
            effect of treatment intensity reduction (under both scenario A and
            B) on invasive breast cancer-free survival, taking into account
            other important factors.
